4. round length and round time


the winner is the person with the most individual points. you get points from accepting bills.

in each round, you propose a bill, and you have the option to accept other people's bills.
you can accept bills from multiple people, and your own bill is automatically accepted for you.
The issue is, only one bill is finally passed each round, AND unanimous agreement is needed to pass.
This means that you may need to convince the few members that lose out from the bill to accept the bill in the short term.


aim of the game: to get the most individual points.
