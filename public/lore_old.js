Raised in this environment, you have a first-hand awareness of the delicate balance between unity and freedom of expression in your city.",

Saxon Musk knew this when planning the demographics of the colony, and world leaders agreed: Mars should have its own government. Not an exciting story, by any means, but the Martian Government do a fair job at maintaining their relationship with the home planet. As a diplomat, you are proud to put your hat in for the first children of Mars."

Back at L2, you discovered your creators were long gone, but the rare minerals shortages that they strove to fulfil were not."
